On his way home, Pinocchio met a fox and a cat. The fox 
was hurt and the cat was blind. They went up to Pinocchio
and they saw the five coins in his hand. The fox said,
â€œHello, Pinocchio, you have pretty coins. I know how to 
make many more coins with the coins you have in your hand. There is 
a place called Field of Miracles.
